# HotelReservationSystem

Hotel Reservation System is a desktop application developed in C# (ASP.NET Core) that simulates the operation of a hotel management system.

The application provides:

guest record management

creation, modification, and deletion of reservations

room management (type, price, availability)

overview of the current reservation status

Data is stored in in-memory collections (without using an external database), allowing a stronger focus on implementing business logic and applying object-oriented programming principles.
